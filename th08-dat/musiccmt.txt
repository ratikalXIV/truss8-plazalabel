Imperishable Night ~ Eastern Night.
No.1 Imperishable Night ~ Eastern Night.
This is the title screen theme.
This title song conjures up the same images as previous games.
I feel it's more fantastical, but it's very Gensokyo.
Does "fantastical" really convey "Gensokyo-like"?
Well, as far as title themes go, this is one of my favorites. 

@bgm/th08_00.mid
Illusionary Night ~ Ghostly Eyes
No.2 Illusionary Night ~ Ghostly Eyes
This is the Stage 1 theme.
In a way, I think it's a jazzy little number. But,
while it's pretty upbeat, it is somewhat dark.
But Imperishable Night is about night and youkai, so it's dark,
too.This song is part of "Ghostly Field Club," so many of you 
might know it. The darkness in Stage 1 doesn't bode very well. 

@bgm/th08_03.mid
Stirring an Autumn Moon ~ Mooned Insect
No.3 Stirring an Autumn Moon ~ Mooned Insect
This is Wriggle Nightbug's theme.
It always feels so explosively Eastern. I created it 
with the innocence of an expressive child mixed with the 
images of night and insects. 40 small, wriggling insects.
All the MIDI versions are extras, not just this song. Please 
listen to the WAV for an element of fantasy that isn't in MIDI.

@bgm/th08_04.mid
Song of the Night Sparrow ~ Night Bird
No.4 Song of the Night Sparrow ~ Night Bird
This is the stage 2 theme.
It peaks quickly, but the franticness leaves a lingering little 
something. That's how I wanted this song to feel. It was meant 
to be my ultimate blend of Japanese and Western styles. On an 
unrelated note, there's nothing wrong with the Gensokyo girls.
They just enjoy living dangerously... 


@bgm/th08_05.mid
Deaf to all but the Song 
No.5 Deaf to all but the Song 
This is Mystia Lorelei's theme.
She's just the Stage 2 boss, but this song makes her sound 
badass. It's a departure from all the songs about mystery
and birds and night and all that weird junk. This one's just 
conveys cute and badass.
It's sort of laid back and doesn't make her seem too evil. 

@bgm/th08_06.mid
Nostalgic Blood of the East ~ Old World
No.6 Nostalgic Blood of the East ~ Old World
This is the Stage 3 theme.
This one is so nostalgic... I'm sure those who are familiar 
with Touhou will recognize it, but it sounds like a song I 
did a few years ago. I made it the same way, so it's very
nostalgic but what good is it if it's only nostalgic to me? (Ha)
This theme is a bit out of place. It has some of my 80's flavor.

@bgm/th08_07.mid
Plain Asia 
No.7 Plain Asia 
This is Keine Kamishirasawa's theme.
It's both serious and mysterious.
I really like the striking melodious feeling conveyed
by the piano in the intro. To me, Japanese culture
is sort of a natural progression in East Asia. So 
Japanese-English music certainly shouldn't be reduced to fluff.

@bgm/th08_08.mid
Retribution for the Eternal Night ~ Imperishable Night.
No.8 Retribution for the Eternal Night ~ Imperishable Night.
This is the Stage 4 theme.
This song is an arrangement of the game's title
screen theme. It has a nice short tempo. For the end,
I put in a laughing sound, like that of a youkai. However,
it's unnatural to hear it in such a mundane way. Altogether,
the rhythm is odd. I feel there's a hint of madness in it. 

@bgm/th08_09.mid
Maiden's Capriccio ~ Dream Battle
No.9 Maiden's Capriccio ~ Dream Battle
This is Reimu Hakurei's theme.
If you're wondering why this theme is nostalgic, 
it's an arrangement of an older song. My 4th version was 
for the Stage 4 boss of Lotus Land Story (Reimu). The pattern
in Stage 4 closely resembles that of Lotus Land Story, so I
thought I'd do a similar song and give some people deja vu.
The other theme for this game is "An Old Memory Called Genso".

@bgm/th08_10.mid
Love-coloured Master Spark 
No.10 Love-coloured Master Spark 
This is Marisa Kirisame's Theme.
At this point, this song isn't all nostalgic and stuff.
Wonderland was my 2nd shot at arranging this particular tune. I
was wondering if this theme still suited Marisa and what shocked
me is that it totally did. It's rare to see someone so unchanged.
Marisa has 5 themes, but I think this one suits her best.

@bgm/th08_11.mid
Cinderella Cage ~ Kagome-Kagome
No.11 Cinderella Cage ~ Kagome-Kagome
This is the Stage 5 theme.
Asian, Western, old, new-- This song isn't one or the other. The 
boss seems that way, too, but the stage itself is based in 
Japanese horror. Each song has a theme but the theme of this one 
is just Kagome Kagome. This song was created with no particular
arrangement. I didn't want to get caged on a theme for this one.

@bgm/th08_12.mid
Lunatic Eyes ~ Invisible Full Moon
No.12 Lunatic Eyes ~ Invisible Full Moon
This is Reisen U. Inaba's theme.
When you think of the final boss of Touhou, this is what
comes to mind. Guess some things never change. (Haha)
After the wild intro, there's a mournful melody in the middle
that exudes delicate beauty.
Everyone seems to like it. 

@bgm/th08_13.mid
Voyage 1969 
No.13 Voyage 1969 
This is the Stage 6 theme.
The 20th century voyager--
The Noah's Ark of the 20th century flew into space, carrying 
with it hopes and fears. And yet, were its hopes left behind on
the moon? Here in the "future", in the 21st century, only fears
and a handful of illusions seem to be all that were brought back.

@bgm/th08_14.mid
Gensokyo Millenium ~ History of the Moon
No.14 Gensokyo Millenium ~ History of the Moon
This is Eirin Yagokoro's theme.
Impossible courage, ferocity, and vigor--
This theme combines all of those, making a ridiculously upbeat
song. All the upbeat goofiness culminates in the final boss
(really?) so shooting to a song like this gets downright
insane. I didn't want to get caged in on a theme for this one.

@bgm/th08_15.mid
Flight of the Bamboo Cutter ~ Lunatic Princess
No.15 Flight of the Bamboo Cutter ~ Lunatic Princess
This is Kaguya Houraisan's theme.
Smooth, huh? (Haha) This song brings out a feeling of aloofness.
I don't express emotions through songs, I make songs with 
emotions. And really, the game makes the songs.
They're not very cool and modern, are they? (Haha)
I'll admit I'm no pro.


@bgm/th08_13b.mid
Voyage 1970 
No.16 Voyage 1970 
This is the Last Spell theme.
All it inspires is a frantic feeling. It's seriously fast.
It's the constant repetition of a short phrase that makes it so
fast. Man, I'd hate to wake up that way. (Haha)
Of course, it is fast, but it also has a mysterious kind of
nostalgia.

@bgm/th08_18.mid
Extend Ash ~ Hourai Victim 
No.17 Extend Ash ~ Hourai Victim 
This is the Extra Stage theme.
Kinda laid back for an extra, huh?
Sorta feels like a test of my courage not to scare anybody.(Not)
I'm actually a little unsure about it, but
I extended it.
I took Extend and extended it.


@bgm/th08_19.mid
Reach for the Moon, Immortal Smoke 
No.18 Reach for the Moon, Immortal Smoke 
This is Fujiwara no Mokou's theme.
I tried to bring out a bit of creepiness to present a restrained
sense of power and overwhelming cool. And even if the song isn't
a little dubious, the character certainly is.
I always like kicking it old school for the Extra Boss song.
This time around I'm really going to kick it old school.

@bgm/th08_16.mid
Evening Primrose 
No.19 Evening Primrose 
This is the Ending theme.
It's still the same. All laid back.
The ending song is never all that upbeat.
And this one is no exception.


@bgm/th08_17.mid
Eternal Dream ~ Mystic Maple 
No.20 Eternal Dream ~ Mystic Maple 
This is the Credits theme.
I added a little nostalgia to this one.
"Maple," such an old memory.
This theme is loaded with old memories,
and there's not enough staff.


@bgm/th08_20.mid
Eastern Youkai Beauty 
No.21 Eastern Youkai Beauty 
This is the Last Word theme.
I wanted it to invoke feelings that deviate from the story.
I'm not trying for coolness.
I'm not trying for cuteness.
I'm not even trying for creepiness.
It may come across that way, but it's really not my intent.
